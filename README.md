# Barbie-Movie-Sentimental-Analysis
This GitHub repository aims to perform sentiment analysis on Barbie movie reviews scraped from the IMDb website. The sentiment analysis is conducted using three different natural language processing (NLP) models: TextBlob, Flair, and VADER. The objective is to analyze the sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of the reviews and determine which model provides the most accurate predictions for Barbie movie sentiments.
